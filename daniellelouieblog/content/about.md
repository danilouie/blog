## About Me

Hi! I'm Danielle, a fourth-year undergraduate at UC Berkeley double-majoring in Sustainable Environmental Design and Data Science. I am passionate about utilizing technology to model and develop sustainable solutions for our environment. Throughout my student career, I have gained valuable experience in data processing and analysis, app developments and deployment, GIS mapping, 3D prototyping, sustainable research.

## Active Projects
Currently, I am a Data Scientist intern at the Eric and Wendy Schmidt Center for Data Science and Environment (DSE). As a part of the [Indigenous Environmental Stewardship](https://dse.berkeley.edu/programs/co-design-technology-tribal-environmental-stewardship) team, I build executables, curate interactive visualizations, and define boundaries for data sovereignty.

I am also a Production Manager Intern for [Climate Break](https://climatebreak.org), podcast production under the Center for Law, Energy & the Environment (CLEE) at UC Berkeley. I manage a team of 20+ student volunteers, delegating tasks, leading meetings, and ensuring that the pipeline flows efficiently. I have also helped to produce several of these episodes, so feel free to check them out!
