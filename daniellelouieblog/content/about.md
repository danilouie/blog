## About Me

Hi! I'm Danielle, a fourth-year undergraduate at UC Berkeley double-majoring in Sustainable Environmental Design and Data Science. I am passionate about utilizing technology to model and develop sustainable solutions for our environment. Throughout my student career, I have gained valuable experience in data processing and analysis, app developments and deployment, GIS mapping, 3D prototyping, sustainable research.

## Active Involvement
Currently, I am a Data Scientist intern at the Eric and Wendy Schmidt Center for Data Science and Environment (DSE). As a part of the <a href="https://dse.berkeley.edu/programs/co-design-technology-tribal-environmental-stewardship" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Indigenous Environmental Stewardship</a> team, I build executables, curate interactive visualizations, and define boundaries for data sovereignty.

I am also a Production Manager Intern for <a href="https://climatebreak.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Climate Break</a>, podcast production under the Center for Law, Energy & the Environment (CLEE) at UC Berkeley. I manage a team of 20+ student volunteers, delegating tasks, leading meetings, and ensuring that the pipeline flows efficiently. I have also helped to produce several of these episodes, so feel free to check them out!

## My Website
This site is a fun, personal project for me to continuously practice my coding skills, present my projects, and share my knowledge with an interested community! If you would like to interactive with my content more in-depth, feel free to browse through this <a href="https://github.com/danilouie/blog/tree/main/daniellelouieblog" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Git Repository</a>.
