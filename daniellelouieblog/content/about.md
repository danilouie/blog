## About Me

Hi! I'm Danielle, a graduate student at USC pursuing an M.S. in Applied Data Science. I recently graduated from UC Berkeley with a B.A. in Data Science and B.A. in Sustainable Environmental Design. I am passionate about utilizing machine learning to design sustainable solutions for our environment. Throughout my student career, I have gained valuable experience in data processing and analysis, app developments and deployment, GIS mapping, 3D prototyping, and sustainable research.

## Active Involvement
Currently, I am a Data Scientist intern at the Eric and Wendy Schmidt Center for Data Science and Environment (DSE). As a part of the <a href="https://dse.berkeley.edu/programs/co-design-environmental-stewardship" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Indigenous Environmental Stewardship</a> team, I build executables, curate interactive visualizations, and define boundaries for data sovereignty.

I am also a Production Manager Intern for <a href="https://climatebreak.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Climate Break</a>, podcast production under the Center for Law, Energy & the Environment (CLEE) at UC Berkeley. I manage a team of 20+ student volunteers, delegating tasks, leading meetings, and ensuring that the pipeline flows efficiently. I have also helped to produce several of these episodes, so feel free to check them out!

## My Website
This site is a fun, personal project for me to continuously practice my coding skills, present my projects, and share my knowledge with an interested community! If you would like to view my website build more in-depth, feel free to browse through this <a href="https://github.com/danilouie/blog/tree/main/daniellelouieblog" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Git Repository</a>.
