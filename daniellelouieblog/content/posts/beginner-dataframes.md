# Introduction {#introduction}
Dataframes, data structures that are very similar to tables, are key elements in data science. They are extremely useful for organizing information, and many instances of data science use dataframes to clean and organize data, manipulate tabular data, or even for producing visualizations. The following tutorial aims to provide a basic overview of useful functions when working with dataframes.

***<u>Notice</u>***
Before following this tutorial, make sure you have Python installed. If you do not have Python, you can look <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> for installation instructions. I also recommend that you have a basic understanding of Python as this tutorial does not cover fundamentals for how to code.
