# Introduction {#introduction}
As an Undergraduate Data Science Intern at <a href="https://dse.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DSE</a> and a member of the <a href="https://dse.berkeley.edu/programs/co-design-technology-tribal-environmental-stewardship" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Indigenous Environmental Stewardship</a> team, I have learned extensively about the role and potential of technology, particularly data, in transforming environmental efforts. The growth of AI and machine learning presents numerous opportunities for improving efficiency and optimization of workflow, allowing for greater human efforts to be placed in developing and designing solutions rather than in repetitive and tedious data cleaning or classification. AI can also improve ways to monitor biodiversity, predict changes in ecosystems, and allocate resources for sustainable efforts due to its capability in comparing Big Data efficiently.

However, as society grows more technologically dependent, there is greater concern over the protection and privacy of data. It has become increasingly difficult for census data to be accurately provided to the public without risking the security that anonymity is meant to provide from hackers and cyber threats. In addition, inappropriate use of AI has fostered colonialism over data, with many case studies involving Indigenous communities. To work with AI means to be ethically aware of the impacts of collaboration, transparent and shared data, and the inclusion of marginalized communities in environmental stewardship through data.

The following blog is meant to share vocabulary that I have learned over the course of my involvement in the field. Many of these terms are commonly used but rarely properly defined (also because the definitions can vary according to the scope of the topic).
