## Overview

The objective of this project was to build an interactive "game" with randomly generated, explorable dungeon maps based on a 2D grid of tiles. You have probably come across games that use this map style, such as Pok√©mon, Fire Emblem, or Stardew Valley! 


For this project, I worked with a partner to develop a dynamic main menu with functionality for generating random dungeon maps based off of user-input seeds. We implemented features for loading saved maps and facilitating a seamless exit from the game. We also incorporated interactive keypress controls and mouse functionality for movement, toggling map tools, and information display, which enhanced user engagement and overall gameplay experience. Below is a short tutorial of an example game play.
