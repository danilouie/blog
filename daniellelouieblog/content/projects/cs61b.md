## Overview

The objective of this project was to build an interactive "game" with randomly generated, explorable dungeon maps based on a 2D grid of tiles. You have probably come across games that use this map style, such as Pok√©mon, Fire Emblem, or Stardew Valley! These games typically use graphical tiles to create a more colorful and lively game experience, but for this project, my partner and I utilized text based tiles. 

## How it works

For this project, my partner and I developed a dynamic main menu with functionality for generating random dungeon maps based off of user-input seeds. We implemented features for loading saved maps and facilitating a seamless exit from the game. We also incorporated interactive keypress controls and mouse functionality for movement, toggling map tools, and information display, which enhanced user engagement and overall gameplay experience. 

## Game Play

The end-game condition is simple: water all the "grass" tiles into "flower" tiles to unlock the final door. Each map starts with 20 grass tiles and a "locked" door in randomly generated locations. The game ends once the all the grass tiles have grown into flowers, and the avatar travels onto the tile containing the now unlocked door.
